    <h1>Must Watch Anime</h1>
    <h2>Looking to start a new show but dont know where to start?<br /> Here's a list binge worthy titles</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Hell's Paradise</h3>
    <p>An anime that revolves around a ninja who was caught during a mission and faces execution.<br> However due to his superhuman body, every attempt failed! So instead he tasked with a mission to find the exilir of life.<br> If sucessful, he'd be freed of his crimes.</p>
<br />
<h3>One Peice</h3>
<p>This one needs no explaintion. I mean it's One Piece, and if you haven't heard of it. I suggest coming back to civilization or at least come out from under the rock.</p>
<br />
<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
<p>With its explosive fight scenes and a gripping backstory that makes you yearn for more. It's easily a must have in your watchlist </p>
